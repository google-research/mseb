# BirdSet

BirdSet is a large-scale dataset for bioacoustic monitoring, focusing on bird
species classification from audio recordings.

## Task Description

The primary task is **Multi-label Classification**. Given a 5-second audio
segment, the model must predict all bird species present in the recording.

## Configurations

BirdSet includes data from various recording sites and setups, referred to as
configurations: - `HSN`: High Sierra Nevada - `NBP`: NiBiolas Point - `POW`:
Powdermill Nature Reserve - `SSW`: Sapsucker Woods - `SNE`: Sierra Nevada -
`PER`: Peru - `NES`: Northeast - `UHH`: Hawaii - `XCM`: Xeno-Canto Mixed -
`XCL`: Xeno-Canto Low-noise
