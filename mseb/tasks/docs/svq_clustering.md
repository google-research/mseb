# SVQ Clustering

Evaluates how well embeddings group by speaker-related attributes.

-   **Attributes:** The dataset provides labels for `speaker_id`,
    `speaker_gender`, and `speaker_age`.
-   **Goal:** Group audio segments based on these metadata labels without using
    the labels during embedding generation.
