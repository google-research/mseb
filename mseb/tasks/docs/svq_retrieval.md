# SVQ Retrieval

The SVQ retrieval task evaluates the model's ability to find relevant Wikipedia
content given a voice query.

-   **In-Lang Retrieval:** The voice query and the Wikipedia content are in the
    same language. This tests native-language semantic alignment.
-   **Cross-Lang Retrieval:** The voice query is in a non-English language,
    while the Wikipedia content is in English. This evaluates the model's
    ability to map cross-lingual concepts into a shared embedding space.
-   **Data:** Both document-level and passage-level retrieval variants are
    supported.
