# BirdSet Clustering

Evaluates the semantic grouping of bird vocalizations in the embedding space.

-   **Goal:** Group bird calls from the same species together without explicit
    supervised labels.
-   **Evaluation:** Primarily uses V-Measure to compare predicted clusters
    against ground-truth species labels.
